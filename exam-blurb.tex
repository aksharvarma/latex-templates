\item \textbf{Logistics:} Read all these instructions. Write your name on the top of every page. \textbf{Write your ID in the blank space provided above the points table on this page.}

\item \textbf{Duration, Problems and Points:} This exam lasts \textbf{\examTotalTime} and has \textbf{\examNumberOfProblems} problems totaling \textbf{\examTotalPoints} points. Make sure to read all problems to decide an order to attempt them that would allow quickest progress.

\item \textbf{Known algorithms:} While describing a new algorithm, you may use any algorithm covered in class as a subroutine without elaboration.

\item \textbf{Proofs and analyses:} You do not need to provide a proof of correctness and/or an analysis of the running time \emph{unless} explicitly asked to.

\item \textbf{Algorithm descriptions:} You do not need to provide pseudo-code \emph{unless} explicitly asked to. A clear description as a sequence of well-specified steps will suffice. If you need extra space, use the blank facing page intended for scratch work.

\item \textbf{Partial Credit:} Points are determined on the basis of both the correctness and the clarity of description. Show your work, as partial credit may be given. Present the best algorithm you can, even if it doesn't meet all desired properties.

\item \textbf{Closed-book exam:} This exam is closed-book. No sources of any kind, electronic or physical, can be consulted during the course of this exam. No collaboration of any kind is permitted.

\item \textbf{Policy on cheating:} Students who violate the above rules on scholastic honesty are subject to disciplinary penalties. Any student caught cheating will \textit{immediately} receive an \textbf{F} (failing grade).
