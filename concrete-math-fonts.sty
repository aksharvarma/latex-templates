% This is a ``package'' that contains many of my preferred math commands
% Particularly, it has things for probability, linear algebra, complexity
% and I'm sure many other miscellaneous things as well.
%
% Author: Akshar Varma
% Some of these commands were inspired by LaTeX code that I picked up from
% those that were used by Daniel Wichs, Huy Nguyen, Ravi Sundaram, Hongyang Zhang
% I have since changed/rewritten a lot of it, but they did inspire aspects.

% Setting the Concrete fonts.
% Requires fontenc
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}
% http://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-concrete
% Also, http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/concmath/concmath.pdf
% This italicizes the math font which looks off after reading the book.
% So don't want that math font.
% \RequirePackage[amsfonts, amssymb, boldsans]{concmath}
% These are a better match, so going with these.
\RequirePackage{ccfonts}        %Order matters
% Euler ensure upright math font.
\RequirePackage{eulervm}        %This should be after other font settings.
% The following line makes sure that the bold font is correct.
% This fixes whatever eulervm messes up for bold fonts.
