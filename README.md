# Templates

A myriad collection of style files, example files, and other template-like LaTeX code for use cases that arise often (for me).

## Course Handouts

A style file for creating handouts to give out to students during courses. Has formatting for problem sets, exams, quizzes, recitation sessions, and a compendium of all problems. Has been utilized for Algorithms courses and has aspects inspired based on courses in various theoretical computer science courses.

## Math Commands

A style file containing an extensive set of macros that are useful for writing mathematical content relevant to fields/topics like probability, matrices, vectors, etc.

## Concrete Mathematics fonts

A small and simple style file to make LaTeX use the fonts from the Concrete Mathematics book by Graham, Knuth, Patashnik.

## Annotated list of useful packages

An uncompilable LaTeX file that simply lists various packages I've found useful in the past with some basic commentary on their use.

## Beamer based templates

Two examples/templates using Beamer, the first for standard presentations and the other for making posters in LaTeX.
